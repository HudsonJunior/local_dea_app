# Local DEA App

This Flutter application was developed as my final project for a Computer Science degree. The app’s primary feature is a map that displays markers showing the nearest Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) to the user’s location, aimed at reducing emergency response time in cardiac events.

## 📍 Key Features

- **Nearest AED Locations**: Displays nearby AEDs on an interactive map.
- **Shortest Route Calculation**: Utilizes the HERE API to find and display the shortest routes to a specific AED or multiple AEDs.
- **Life-Saving Focus**: Designed to facilitate rapid AED access, potentially saving lives during cardiac emergencies.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Frontend development and UI.
- **HERE API**: Route calculations and map functionalities.

## 💡 Project Purpose

This app addresses the need for rapid access to AEDs during emergencies, aiming to make locating and reaching the nearest device as efficient as possible to potentially save lives.
